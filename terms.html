								Sanela.</b>

							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanela does not provide
								medical advice or care. For purposes of these Terms of Use,
								“medical, “medical advice,” or “medical care” includes
								nutritional, behavioral, psychological, and veterinary
								information and advice. and other independent, physician-owned
								medical groups with a network of Providers who provide virtual
								care services. Providers deliver clinical services via the
								Sanela platform to their patients. Providers are not employed by
								Sanela. The Providers, and not Sanela, are responsible for the
								quality and appropriateness of the care they render to you.
								Sanela do not provide any legal advice or representations in any
								way regarding any legal issues associated with advice,
								information, goods, or services offered by a Provider, including
								but not limited to any compliance obligations or steps necessary
								to comply with any state or federal laws and regulations.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Providers are
								independent of Sanela and are merely using the Site as a way to
								communicate with you. Any information or advice received from a
								Provider comes from them alone, and not from Sanela. Neither
								Sanela, nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any third
								party who may promote the Site or Service or provide a link to
								the Service, shall be liable for any professional advice
								obtained from a Provider via the Site or Service, nor any
								information obtained on the Site. </span><b>Sanela</b><span
								style="font-weight: 400;"> does not recommend or endorse
								any specific Providers, tests, physicians, medications,
								products, or procedures. You acknowledge that your reliance on
								any Providers or information delivered by the Providers via the
								Site or Service is solely at your own risk and you assume full
								responsibility for all risks associated herewith. </span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Providers listed
								through the Services enter into contracts with us, and may pay
								us a fee in order to be marketed through or to use the Services.
								To help you find Providers who may be suitable for your needs,
								and enable the maximum choice and diversity of Providers
								participating in the Services, we will provide you with lists
								and/or profiles of Providers. These results are based on
								information that you provide to us, such as insurance
								information, geographical location, and healthcare specialty.
								They may also be based on other criteria (including, for
								example, Provider availability, past selections by and/or
								ratings of Providers by you or by other Site users, and past
								experience of Site users with Providers). </span><b>Sanela</b><span
								style="font-weight: 400;"> does not (a) recommend or
								endorse any Providers, or (b) make any representations or
								warranties about the training or skill of any Providers who
								deliver services via the Site or Service. You will be provided
								with available Providers based solely on the information you
								submit to the Site. Sanela does not receive any additional fees
								from Providers for featuring them (i.e., higher or better
								placement on lists) through the Services (subject to Sponsored
								Results as described below). Note, however, to the extent that
								you use the Services as provided by your employer, Sanela may
								provide lists and/or profile previews based also on criteria
								determined by your employer and your employer’s agents or
								advisors. In addition, to the extent that Sanela serves as a
								platform for, or provides technical support to, the provider
								directory associated with your health coverage, Providers will
								appear in the directory based on criteria determined by your
								health plan or plan sponsor, as applicable. We may show you
								advertisements or sponsored results (“Sponsored Results”) on the
								Site, including above the search results. Sanela receives
								additional fees from Providers for providing Sponsored Results.
								Sponsored Results shown through the Services are not, and should
								not be considered, an endorsement or recommendation by Sanela of
								the Provider. You are ultimately responsible for choosing your
								own particular Provider.</span>

								and the Services, including without limitation, text, copy,
								audio, video, photographs, illustrations, graphics and other
								visuals, is for informational purposes only and does not
								constitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or
								recommendations of any kind by Sanela. You should always seek
								the advice of your qualified health care professionals with any
								questions or concerns you may have regarding your individual
								needs and any medical conditions. All information provided by
								Sanela, or in connection with any communications supported by
								Sanela, is intended to be for general information purposes only,
								and is in no way intended to create a provider-patient
								relationship as defined by state or federal law. While Sabela
								facilitates your selection of, and communications with,
								Providers, Sanela itself does not provide medical services, and
								the doctor/provider-patient relationship is between you and the
								Provider you select.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>3.Not for Emergencies</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU SHOULD
								DIAL EMERGENCY NUMBER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR PlACE IMMEDIATELY.</b><span
								style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanela’s Site and Services
								are </span><b>not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for
								medical emergencies or urgent situations. You should not
								disregard or delay to seek medical advice based on anything that
								appears or does not appear on the Site. If you believe you have
								an emergency, call emergency number in your local area
								immediately.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should seek emergency
								help or follow up care when recommended by a Provider or when
								otherwise needed. You should continue to consult with your
								primary provider and other healthcare professionals as
								recommended. Always seek the advice of a physician or other
								qualified healthcare provider concerning questions you have
								regarding a medical condition and before stopping, starting, or
								modifying any treatment or modification.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Risks of Telehealth Services</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">By using the Site and
								Services, you acknowledge the potential risks associated with
								telehealth services. These include but are not limited to the
								following: information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g.
								poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical or
								health care decision making by the Provider; delays in
								evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of
								electronic equipment; a lack of access to complete medical
								records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic
								reactions or other judgment errors; although the electronic
								systems we use incorporate network and software security
								protocols to protect the privacy and security of health
								information, those protocols could fail causing a breach of
								privacy of your health information.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Prescriptions and Product Policy</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanela does not endorse
								any specific medication, pharmacy, product, supplies, equipment,
								or devices. If a Provider prescribes a medication or product,
								he/she must limit supply based upon state regulations and will
								only prescribe a medication or product as determined in his/her
								own discretion and professional judgment. There is no guarantee
								a prescription will be written. Providers reserve the right to
								deny care for actual or potential misuse of the Services.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that any
								prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider will be solely
								for your personal use. You agree to fully and carefully read all
								provided product information and labels and to contact a
								physician or pharmacist if you have any questions regarding the
								prescription. </span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b><i>Sanela fully honors patient freedom of choice and,
									if you receive a prescription for a medication, you always have
									the option to instruct the Provider to transmit that
									prescription to the pharmacy of your choice.</i></b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Not an Insurance Product</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanela is not a health
								insurance or malpractice insurance company, the Site and
								Services are not insurance products, and the amounts you pay to
								Sanela or Providers are not insurance premiums. If you desire
								any type of health, malpractice, or other insurance, you will
								need to purchase such insurance yourself.</span>
						</p>

							<b>4. Requests for Products and Services</b>
						</h5>
						<p></p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Providers</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can purchase Products
								and Services on the Site or through a third party by paying a
								monthly subscription fee provided to you at the time of your
								subscription, which may be subject to change at your next
								monthly billing cycle upon no earlier than 10 days’ notice to
								you. By purchasing a Product or Service, you agree to an initial
								and recurring monthly fee at the monthly rate, as well as any
								sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments, and
								you accept responsibility for all recurring charges until you
								cancel your subscription. The applicable fee and taxes will be
								charged to your credit card on the date your membership is
								created and every monthly billing period thereafter, on the day
								corresponding to the monthly commencement of your membership
								(the “Membership Anniversary Day”). If your Membership
								Anniversary Day, the date of expiry of your current billing
								period, does not exist in a particular month (because your
								Membership Anniversary Day is the 29th, 30th or the 31st of the
								month) then we will charge your credit card on the last day of
								that month. If you enroll to make recurring payments
								automatically, all charges and fees will be billed to the credit
								card you designate during the setup process. If you want to
								designate a different credit card or if there is a change in
								your credit card, you must change your information online. This
								may temporarily delay your ability to make online payments while
								we verify your new payment information.</span>

								Services Agreement, as they may be modified by Stripe from time
								to time. As a condition of Sanela enabling payment processing
								services through Stripe, you agree to provide Sanela accurate
								and complete information about you and your business, and you
								authorize Sanela to share it and transaction information related
								to your use of the payment processing services provided by
								Stripe. If a credit card account is being used for a
								transaction, Sanela or Stripe may obtain preapproval for an
								amount up to the amount of the payment.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">You represent and warrant
								that if you are making online payments that (i) any credit card,
								debit card and bank account information you supply is true,
								correct and complete, (ii) charges incurred by you will be
								honored by your credit/debit card company or bank, (iii) you
								will pay the charges incurred by you in the amounts posted,

						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your payment to Sanela
								will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period,
								unless you cancel through your subscription page before the end
								of the current subscription period. You may cancel your
								membership at any time by filling out the cancellation form on
								your account page, or you may also email a request using the
								contact information below (Section 28). </span><b>Please have
								available and/or include the email associated with your account
								if you cancel by email. If you do not include such email, then
								you acknowledge and accept that your cancellation may be delayed
								or not accepted.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The
								cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the
								current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the
								standard non-subscription service. However, if you cancel your
								payment or Service and/or terminate any of these Terms of Use
								before the end of the current subscription period, we will not
								refund any subscription fees already paid to us. </span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not wish your
								subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or
								terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your
								account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription,
								even if you have otherwise deleted your Account with us or if
								you have deleted the Site from your devices. Deleting your
								Account with us or deleting the Site from your devices does not
								cancel your subscription; Sanela will retain all funds charged
								to your account until you cancel your subscription through your
								account page. If you are a California based subscriber, you may
								cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any
								time prior to midnight of the third business day following the
								date you subscribed.</span>

								information, you agree that Sanela is authorized to immediately
								charge your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to
								your Provider and that no additional notice or consent is
								required.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanela, on behalf of your
								Provider, reserves the right to modify or implement a new
								pricing structure at any time prior to billing you for your
								initial payment or for future payments due pursuant to this
								Agreement.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a dispute
								concerning any payment transaction, please contact our Support
								department. If, at any time, you contact your bank or credit
								card company to reject the charge of any payable fees
								(“Chargeback”), this act will be considered a breach of your
								payment obligations, and we reserve the right to automatically
								terminate your use of the Services. We reserve the right to
								dispute any Chargeback and take all reasonable action to
								authorize the transaction. In the event of a Chargeback, your
								Account may be terminated and any files, data, or content
								contained in your Account may be subject to cancellation. Sanela
								will not be liable for any loss of files, data, or content as a
								result of a Chargeback. In order to resume use of the Services,
								you must re-subscribe for the Services and pay all applicable
								fees for the Service as well as any fees incurred by us or our
								payment processor as a result of the Chargeback.</span>

						</h5>
						<p>
							<b>General</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">These supplemental terms
								apply to Providers in addition to the other provisions of these
								Terms of Use. In the event of a conflict between the
								supplemental terms and any other terms herein, the supplemental
								terms shall prevail.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">To be a healthcare
								provider using the Site (“Provider” or “you”) you must be a
								physician or other healthcare professional, and duly
								licensed/registered under applicable state and international
								law, as required, and must agree to comply with all laws,
								professional licensing board rules and other rules and
								regulations applicable to you as a Provider or otherwise. You
								represent and warrant that, at all times while using the Site,
								you have medical malpractice insurance coverage satisfying the
								requirements of all jurisdictions in which you are licensed or
								registered. Your relationship with the SANELA users (including
								your patients) is directly between you and the patient. The
								patient will never have a physician-patient or provider-patient
								relationship with Sanela. Sanela does not practice medicine and
								offers no medical or healthcare services. As set forth more
								fully below, Provider is solely responsible for all agreements,
								consents, notices and other interactions with patients and other
								consumers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
								Provider is solely responsible for all billings and collections
								from patients and other consumers, and Sanela shall have no
								liability whatsoever to Provider with respect to any amounts
								owed by any patient or other consumer to Provider.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanela does not provide
								any medical advice, legal advice, or representations in any way
								regarding any legal or medical or healthcare issues associated
								with Provider, or goods or services or Products offered by
								Provider, including but not limited to any compliance
								obligations or steps necessary to comply with any state or
								federal laws and regulations. Provider should seek legal counsel
								regarding any legal and compliance issues, and must not rely on
								any materials or content associated with the Services in
								determining Provider’s compliance obligations under law.
								Provider and Sanela agree that Sanela is not providing, to the
								Site users or anyone else, medical advice or legal advice.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Provider will use the Site
								and Services only in accordance with applicable standards of
								good medical or healthcare practice. While software products
								such as the Site and Services can facilitate and improve the
								quality of service that Provider can offer patients, many
								factors, including the provider-patient relationship, can affect
								a patient outcome, and with intricate and interdependent
								technologies and complex decision-making it is often difficult
								or impossible to accurately determine what the factors were and
								in what proportion they affected an outcome. Provider shall be
								solely responsible for its use of the Site and Services, and the
								provision of medical or healthcare services to Provider’s
								patients. In this regard, Provider releases Sanela and waives
								any and all potential claims against Sanela as a result of
								Provider’s use of the Site and Services, and the provision of
								services to Provider’s patients.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>As a result of the complexities and uncertainties inherent
								in the patient care process, Provider agrees to defend,
								indemnify and hold Sanela harmless from any claim by or on
								behalf of any patient of Provider, or by or on behalf of any
								other third party or person claiming damage by virtue of a
								familial or financial relationship with such a patient, which is
								brought against Sanela, regardless of the cause if such claim
								arises for any reason whatsoever, out of Provider’s use or
								operation of the Site and Services</b><span
								style="font-weight: 400;">. Provider will obtain Sanela’s
								prior written consent to any settlement or judgment in which
								Provider agrees to any finding of fault of Sanela or defect in
								the Site or Services. Sanela will promptly notify Provider in
								writing of any claim subject to this indemnification, promptly
								provide Provider with the information reasonably required for
								the defense of the same, and grant to Provider exclusive control

								and other consumers. You agree not to contact other users

								Content into any form, medium, or technology throughout the
								world. Sanela is and shall be under no obligation (1) to
								maintain any Provider Content in confidence; (2) to pay to you
								any compensation for any Provider Content; or (3) to respond to
								any Provider Content.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanela does not regularly
								review Provider Content but does reserve the right (but not the
								obligation) to monitor and edit or remove any Provider Content
								submitted to the Site. You grant Sanela the right to use the
								name that you submit in connection with any Provider Content.
								You agree not to use a false email address, impersonate any
								person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any
								Provider Content. You are and shall remain solely responsible
								for the content of any Provider Content you post to the Site or
								provide to patients or other consumers. Sanela and its

								any Provider Content submitted by you or any third party.</span>

							<b>Access Rights of the Provider’s Accounts</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer the Services to
								Providers and to natural persons who are members of such
								Providers’ Authorized Workforce, as more fully described below.
								All persons who sign up for an account on behalf of a Provider
								must furnish, among other things, that Provider’s full legal
								name and fictitious business name(s) (i.e., trade name, d/b/a or
								“doing business as”) as part of the sign-up process. We treat
								the Provider in whose name the account is established as the
								owner of all accounts associated with such Provider, and we call
								this Provider the “Provider of Record.”</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Provider of Record is
								a party to this Agreement for all purposes and shall be subject
								to all of the provisions are applicable to the person addressed
								as “you” in this Agreement.” Although a member of a Provider of
								Record’s Authorized Workforce may have signed-up for an account
								or electronically entered into this Agreement, or may continue
								to administer Administrative Rights on the Provider of Record’s
								behalf, only the Provider of Record is entitled to any of the
								rights, remedies, or benefits under this Agreement and control
								over the Administrative Rights. The Provider of Record is
								likewise subject to, and we may enforce against, all of the
								covenants, obligations, restrictions, limitations,
								acknowledgements, Consents, representations, warranties,
								waivers, and releases included in this Agreement. The Provider
								of Record may delegate Administrative Rights to one or more
								members of the Provider of Record’s Authorized Workforce, but
								the Provider of Record remains responsible for all activity

						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">We apply the standards of

								responsible for ensuring that your PHI may properly be disclosed
								for the purposes set forth in this Agreement, subject to the

								In particular, you will: (i) not make available to other users
								through the Services any information in violation of any
								restriction on use or disclosure (whether arising from your
								agreement with such users or under law); (ii) obtain all
								necessary consents, authorizations, or releases from individuals

								collectively, “Provider Directories”). Provider Directories may
								be made available in various electronic formats, including
								searchable databases, Provider landing pages, interactive
								reference tools, reference lists, and integrated look-up
								features, among others. They may also incorporate information
								designed to help users, such as integrated maps, and licensure
								confirmation tools, among others. Provider Directories may
								include a “contact” feature that allows users to contact other
								users directly through the Services. Our Public Provider
								Directory may be made available to public search engines to aid
								Provider discovery. Listing in the Provider Directories is
								subject to eligibility criteria, which may differ between the
								Public Provider Directory and Professional Provider Directory.
								“A Provider’s “Directory Information” includes the Provider’s
								name, name(s) of physicians or other healthcare professionals
								associated with a Provider, associated specialties, Provider’s
								business telephone number(s) and physical address(es), National
								Provider Identifiers (or NPI), and the Provider’s available

						<p>
							<b>Sanela’s Responsibilities</b>

								Platform Services, in each case:</span>
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Telemedicine

							<b>20. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement</b>
						</h5>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will try work in good
								faith to resolve any issue you have with Site, including
								Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Site, if
								you bring that issue to the attention of our customer service
								department. However, we realize that there may be rare cases
								where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a customer’s
								satisfaction.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Sanela agree that
								any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in
								any way to these Terms of Use or your use of the Site, including
								Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Site,
								shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts
								of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than
								bringing a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
								arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and is subject to very
								limited review by courts. Arbitration allows for more limited
								discovery than in court, however, we agree to cooperate with
								each other to agree to reasonable discovery in light of the
								issues involved and amount of the claim. Arbitrators can award
								the same damages and relief that a court can award, but in so
								doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding
								damages as if the matter had been brought in court, including
								without limitation, the law on punitive damages as applied by
								the United States Supreme Court. You agree that, by agreeing to
								these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the
								interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you
								and Sanela are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
								participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall
								survive termination of these Terms of Use and any other
								contractual relationship between you and Sanela.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you desire to assert a
								claim against Sanela, and you therefore elect to seek
								arbitration, you must first send to Sanela, by certified mail, a
								written notice of your claim (“Notice”). The Notice to Sanela
								should be addressed to: Sanela, Inc, Attn: Legal, 29 Duttonwood
								Ln, Milptias, CA 95035. If Sanela desires to assert a claim
								against you and therefore elects to seek arbitration, it will
								send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the most recent
								address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. A
								Notice, whether sent by you or by Sanela, must (a) describe the
								nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the
								specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Sanela and you do not
								reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days
								after the Notice is received, you or Sanela may commence an
								arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.
								During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made
								by Sanela or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You
								may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate
								arbitration from the American Arbitration Association at
								www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after
								Sanela receives notice at the Notice Address that you have
								commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your
								payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US
								$5,000. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial
								Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
								Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American
								Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of
								Use, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and
								Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
								1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them from us by writing to us
								at the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of
								these Terms of Use. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
								including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of
								these Terms of Use, including this arbitration agreement. Unless
								Sanela and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
								take place in Austin, Texas. (If you reside outside of the
								United States, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the
								parties, any arbitration hearings will take place
								telephonically, but will remain subject to the AAA Rules
								including the AAA rules regarding the selection of an
								arbitrator). If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree
								that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted
								solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,
								through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
								established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US $10,000,
								the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
								Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
								the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
								sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
								which the award is based. Except as expressly set forth herein,
								the payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
								will be governed by the AAA Rules. Each party shall pay for its
								own costs and attorneys’ fees, if any. However, if any party
								prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party
								attorneys’ fees, or if there is a written agreement providing
								for payment or recovery attorneys’ fees, the arbitrator may
								award reasonable fees to the prevailing party, under the
								standards for fee shifting provided by law.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">YOU AND Sanela AGREE THAT
								EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
								INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
								ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further,
								unless both you and Sanela agree otherwise, the arbitrator may
								not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims,
								and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative
								or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
								injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
								relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
								warranted by that party’s individual claim.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this agreement to
								Arbitrate provision is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the
								entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void,
								but the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain
								in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and
								venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts located
								in and for Austin, Texas.</span>
